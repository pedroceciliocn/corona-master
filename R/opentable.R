# About the data:
# This data shows year-over-year seated diners at restaurants on the OpenTable
# network across all channels: online reservations, phone reservations, and
# walk-ins. For year-over-year comparisons by day, we compare to the same day of
# the week from the same week in the previous year. For example, weâ€™d compare
# Tuesday of week 11 in 2020 to Tuesday of week 11 in 2019. Only states or
# cities with 50+ restaurants in the sample are included. All restaurants on the
# OpenTable network in either period are included.
